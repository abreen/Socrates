This is the Markdown source code of the Socrates documentation. It can
be built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org).

The `gh-pages` branch of this repository contains the HTML output that
MkDocs produces when

    mkdocs gh-deploy --clean

is executed. See the [MkDocs user
guide](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) for more.
